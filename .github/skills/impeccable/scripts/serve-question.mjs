 * Options render as large cards: the comp leads when present, with the

 *   --schema   print the canonical payload example and exit.
 *   --start    for harnesses that cannot leave a shell blocked: daemonize the
 *              server, print QUESTION URL + QUESTION KEY, exit immediately.
 *              Never auto-opens a browser: the agent routes the URL to the
 *              best surface it has (in-app browser first, then the system
 *              opener); pass --open to force the system browser instead.
 *   --wait --key K [--poll 60]   poll for the answer: exit 0 + ANSWER line,
 *              exit 3 WAITING (run --wait again), exit 2 server gone,
 *              exit 4 PAGE CLOSED (the tab went away without an answer;
 *              re-present, reopen the URL, or fall back).
 *   --stop --key K               kill a daemonized question.
 *   --update --key K --payload F deliver the next hand after a re-roll: the
 *              live page swaps to loading cards when the user re-rolls, and
 *              reloads into this new payload the moment it lands. Always the
 *              same key the round started with; a second --start serves a new
 *              URL and strands the open tab on a hand that never arrives.
 *
 * --timeout bounds the wait for a page to arrive, never the user's decision:
 * once the page heartbeats, the server lives while the page does, and exits
 * only after --idle-grace seconds (default 600) pass with no beat, wide
 * enough to survive a closed laptop lid mid-decision.

Salience parity: when the assigned card declares no comp (no image generation this round), catalog art on every card demotes to a labeled thumb, so what looks important is the verdict’s call, never rendering luck. canonCard renders the standing exit as a subordinate card with the same anatomy; without it, canon stays a quiet footer action. Include canon only for visual-direction rounds; never present it as your own recommendation. The pick card is a kicker convention, not a field: kicker "IMPECCABLE’S PICK" on your top-ranked grounded candidate, one at most, never in the lead slot. Every card gets the full anatomy, challengers, canon, and declined included: thesis, palette, materials, viewport, risk; the seed already hands you each challenger’s system rules, so a card with no palette chips is an authoring gap, not a data gap. Keep thesis and each fact to one short sentence: the card front shows thesis, identity, and a two-line risk, while first viewport and the case read on the card back behind the Details chip, so long facts cost the reader a flip, not the page its scanability. A card with no imagery at all has no back; its full read renders on the front, so a text-only round loses nothing. A card may instead declare "wireframe" ({"cols":12,"rows":10,"regions":[{"label":"nav rail","x":0,"y":0,"w":3,"h":10,"accent":true}]}): the page draws it as a layout schematic in the media slot; surface-scope rounds use it on code-led builds, it never counts toward salience, and the card keeps its full read on the front. The comp slot carries the card’s full-fidelity direction comp (the legacy key "sketch" is accepted as an alias). Comp aspect follows the surface: portrait at device viewport for native or mobile-first surfaces, landscape otherwise; the page adapts its cards to either. reroll accepts true or { "registers": ["safer", "bolder"] }: the register buttons steer the next hand along the familiar-to-bold axis, the answer carries "register", and you re-run concept-seed with --register <value> for the next round; offer the registers on direction rounds, and never pre-select one. buildPath rides the payload as { "value": "comp"|"code", "toggle": true }: the value is the recorded default (.impeccable/config.json buildPath, or .impeccable/config.local.json where one machine differs) and the toggle renders a footer switch whose flip binds that session only; the ANSWER then carries buildPath plus buildPathFlipped. On a code-led round each card still declares its comp path as a flip reserve: wireframes render, and a flip to comp makes --wait return once with BUILD PATH FLIPPED so you generate the comps into the declared slots while the round stays open; a flip back to code is free, and a comp that already landed stays as the critique reference. The toggle may only be offered when image generation exists: a harness with no image tool and no API key never sets toggle: true, so the choice never renders where comps cannot be made, and code-led simply rides as the untoggleable value. followup: true keeps the table open after a pick for a second round via --update; send the next payload immediately, the page is waiting on it.');
