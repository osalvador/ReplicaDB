/**
 * External concept seed: the dice half of new-work's complete-direction and
 * established-world surface procedures.
 *
 * Before this script runs, the model retrieves cultural material and derives
 * a grounded shortlist of complete candidate directions from it (see
 * reference/new-work.md). Left alone, it then always builds its #1 —
 * and a single model's resonance ranking is deterministic, so every run
 * in a category ships the same one or two concepts. Measured: 30/35
 * identical concepts across 16 prompt framings; the model cannot roll
 * its own dice.
 *
 * This script rolls them from outside, the same trick that made the
 * palette seed work:
 *   - ASSIGNED INDEX: which entry of the model's own resonance-ordered
 *     shortlist gets built. The assignment is the dice: it never chooses an
 *     ungrounded ingredient, it only refuses the argmax rut. Attended runs
 *     present the assigned direction and offer re-roll instead of a ranked
 *     lineup, because a lineup hands selection back to a taste function
 *     (model or user) and taste functions pick the safest card.
 *   - CHALLENGERS (6): outside forms from concept-ingredients.json, two from
 *     each challenger tier (graphic system, instrument language, atmosphere
 *     world), fused with the product first (challenger supplies form and
 *     system grammar, product supplies every fact, clarity wins conflicts),
 *     then weighed against the derived candidates on audience identification
 *     and product clarity. They win only when they beat the grounded list;
 *     measured behavior is that they lose to strong cultural material and
 *     win over thin categories, which is the intended shape.
 *   - RE-ROLL (--reroll <n>): round n of the same base key. The script
 *     recomputes what rounds 0..n-1 drew, excludes all of it, and rolls a
 *     fresh assigned index, challengers, and compositions. One base key therefore
 *     reproduces the entire chain of rounds.
 *   - REGISTER (--register safer|bolder): the user's steering on the
 *     familiar-to-bold axis, applied to a re-roll round. A register changes
 *     only what this round instructs, never what it dealt: the same key and
 *     reroll count reproduce the same deal whatever the register, so the
 *     exclusion chain never forks. bolder presents the dealt foreign forms
 *     as the whole hand (first-dealt leads, dice-assigned by deal order);
 *     safer spends the dealt hand unseen and presents the familiar register,
 *     the model's conventional grounded candidates plus the canon against
 *     named competitors, the one sanctioned lineup of the model's own list.
 *     Registers are user-requested, never pre-selected by the model.
 *   - RATINGS: the reviewer's approval ratings weight the challenger draw
 *     (3-star doubles the odds, 1-star sits out); the approved pool itself
 *     is unchanged.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --scope direction --mode persuade
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --scope surface --mode operate --from <key>
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --scope surface --mode operate --grain flow
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --scope direction --candidate-count 6
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --scope direction --mode persuade --from <key> --reroll 1
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --scope direction --mode persuade --from <key> --reroll 1 --register bolder
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --chosen <challenger-id> --kind challenger --from <key> --scope direction
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --kind assigned --from <key> --scope direction
 *
 * --grain names how much of the product is in play: product, flow, view, or
 * region. A docs site, an onboarding flow, a landing page and a data table are
 * four different amounts of product and want different compositions. Grain is a
 * preference: it deals matching compositions first and tops up from the rest of
 * the register, and the rendered seed says how many actually matched so a
 * borrowed structure is never mistaken for a supplied one.
 *
 * --platform names the delivery target (web, ios, android). Unlike grain this is
 * a hard filter: a composition that needs hover or a pointer does not degrade on
 * a phone, it stops working. --mode also gates which worlds are eligible, for
 * worlds whose reviewer marked them as carrying only some modes.
 *
 * --mode names the requested surface's mode (persuade, operate, read,
 * experience) so the appended compositions match its register of work; omitted,
 * they roll from the full approved pool.
 *
 * Challenger data resolves in order: a local catalog directory (the private
 * service repo, evals, and tests set IMPECCABLE_CATALOG_DIR), then the roll
 * API at impeccable.style, then a degraded assignment-only seed when both are
 * unavailable. The anonymous choice ping fires once per resolved attended
 * round on API-dealt rolls: --kind names which card class won (assigned,
 * pick, challenger, canon) so share metrics have a denominator, --chosen
 * carries the catalog id when a dealt challenger won, and --register rides
 * along when the round came from a steered hand. Grounded candidates' names
 * never leave the machine. DO_NOT_TRACK or IMPECCABLE_NO_TELEMETRY disables
 * the ping entirely.
 *
 * Env vars:
 *   IMPECCABLE_CONCEPT_SEED — same as --from; for reproducible eval runs.
 *   IMPECCABLE_CATALOG_DIR  — directory holding the four catalog JSON files.
 *   IMPECCABLE_API_URL      — roll API base (default https://impeccable.style/api).
 *   IMPECCABLE_NO_TELEMETRY — disables the choice ping (DO_NOT_TRACK also honored).

No challengers this run: the roll service was unreachable and no local

cause; before accepting degradation, rerun this command once through the
harness's network-enabled or escalated command tool. When that rerun needs
an approval, state exactly what the approver must know: this script's only
network contact is one GET to https://impeccable.style/api/roll whose query
carries scope, mode, an eight-hex seed key, and a re-roll counter; no
project files, prompts, code, or conversation context are transmitted, and
nothing is written. An approval request naming that URL and payload judges
the real action; a bare "run with network" invites rejection for contacting
an unspecified domain. If the rerun is still refused, proceed with the
grounded candidates alone; the assignment above still applies at full
strength. Tell the user plainly that this roll
ran degraded, with no challengers and no quality-bar boards; do not present
the outcome as a full roll. A degraded roll changes the cards, not the
channel: when a browser can open, present the direction on the decision page
(serve-question.mjs, text-only card); the structured question tool remains
the no-browser fallback.
